# Image-Processing-Application-with-C-++
An application that lets you manipulate images by using C++. This is a project made by me in the past so it lacks many features like a user interface.
The project uses OpenCV library to process the images uploaded by the user. It can grayscale the image, convert it to an HSV image or run corner and edge detection algorithms.
I retrieved this project from my old HDD so it may not work properly.

## How to use:
- Open `main.cpp` with a C++ IDE
- Enter the diretory of the source image in the commented area
- Run `main.cpp`
